That men need to be closed off. Silent when it comes to emotions and mental health. And I have been trained, as a man, to be tough. To not show my feelings. To “act like a man”. But to “act like a man” shouldn't mean, not to have emotion or feeling. It shouldn't mean that I have to roll with the punches, rub some dirt on it and get back up for the next one. It shouldn't mean that I can't cry when I'm most vulnerable. For me, being a man means accepting the fact that you can't fix every problem. Being a man means that I can wear my emotions on my sleeve and not have it trapped and locked inside. Being a man means being able to accept that, It Is Okay To Not Be Okay.</figcaption>

I masked out my watch, and used a picture that I took on my vacation to Puerto Rico. Once I chose that picture, the idea came to me. The advertisement is made to blow up to be a billboard ad. Big, simple to read, and easy to understand. This piece makes me miss PR too much.');MM_setTextOfLayer('title','','Billboard Poster')"/>

She appreciates a good wine just like every other hard working woman, so I decided to make a New Years magazine ad for a fictional wine brand called MIA. The ad shows a bottle of water pouring into two champagne glasses. I edited the color of the water to give it a pink hue. I used a transitional serif font for the text and a nice, marker-felt, handwritten font for the Brand logo. Everything in the ad was made in Photoshop.');MM_setTextOfLayer('title','','MIA Rose')"/>

This poster is for a fictional horror movie called “THE AWAKENING”. I used a combination of layer masks, brushes and typography to make it look cinema ready. I used brushes and adjustment layers to make myself look damaged/beat up. Behind the cinema and poster feel, this piece is supposed to represent my internal conflicts and feelings.

This piece is a reflection on the dark times of 2020. When humanity hated themselves more than anything else.

The feeling of exhaustion but the will to move and grow through the struggles of protest. Then I wanted to predict the foreseeable future.
