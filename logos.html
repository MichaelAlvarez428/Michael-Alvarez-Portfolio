This is a beef jerky brand that specializes in spicy jerky. In my research I came across a lot of western themes. So I thought, what is more western than taxonomy (I do not condone taxonomy). So the logo I created is a bull skull on a plaque with a very neutral color scheme using beiges and grays. To show that it\'s spicy I put layered flames behind the mount and on the horns. I added a ribbon with the word mark on the bottom for unification. The flames and wordmark change based off the flavor of the jerky.')"/>
