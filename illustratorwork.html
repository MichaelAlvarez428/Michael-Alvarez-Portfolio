Scorched Earth, Lemon Pepper, and Flaming Blue Ranch each having their own unique color schemes. I had lots of fun making descriptions and nutrition facts on the back and having each bag have its own personality.');MM_setTextOfLayer('title','','Foil Package')"/>

And if they do, it is a very slight accent color. I wanted to change that. I used the colors associated with Love and Passion and ran with them.

For my Frozen Food Box I take heavy inspiration on spanish tile design and other competitors empanada boxes. I made the pattern and die cut of the box from scratch on illustrator. All of the images on the packaging are original to me and edited in Photoshop. I think that the hardest part of this project was taking pictures of the empanadas instead of eating them right away.');MM_setTextOfLayer('title','','Frozen Food Box')"/>

Until I found a picture of a celebrity, Bad Bunny, where he is laying on the floor in a similar position that I am in, in my magazine cover. When designing the cover, I wanted to use colors from the hat I was wearing. I wanted the hat and my face to be the center point. So the blue in the background was taken from the hat and the red was taken from the logo of my hat. I edited my eye color to a similar blue And I saturated my lip color so it can be similar to the red to show repetition. My photo was edited in Photoshop, and the magazine design was made in Illustrator.');MM_setTextOfLayer('title','','HIM Magazine')"/>
